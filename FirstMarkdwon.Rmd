Add text here. Just use it like a typewriter, and add as much or as little as you like.

New text appears here in a separate paragraph.

Use 2 or more blank sapces at the end of a single-spaced line to render to a new line.

# First level header

## Second level header

### Third level header

# Basic text formating

italic *text* like this


bold **text** like this

subscript~text~ like this 

superscript^text^ like this

strikethrough ~~text~~ like this

# Lists

    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
    
## Ordered lists

1. Item 1

# Fencing

In line fencing with a backtick `to show anything in plain text with *no* formatting` which can be useful for many things.

In line execution of r inside the backticks by inserting r as the first element `r 3 + pi`

In line execution of r inside the backticks by inserting r as the first element `3 + pi`

3 backticks for a whole section of plain text

```
everything in here is in plain text. 
even single lines.

useful especially when showing other coding instructions.
```

# Block quotes with `>`

> To be or not to be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler... blah blah blah

# SPacer line with 3 or more underscores

___

Adds a line between text...

# Linkes
http://example.com

[linked phrase](http://example.com) 

A [linked phrase][id]. 

At the bottom of the document:

[id]: http://example.com/ "Title"

# Images

Can either be on the web or in the same directory that the code is sitting.

Example:
`![alt text][id]`
`![alt text][figure/img.png]`

# Table

# LaTeX code for equations

We set off equations `$` for brackets.

## In-line equations appear inside

These equations such as $a = 3 + 4$ will appear inside of a single line of text.

These equations such as $$a = 3 + 4$$ will appear in a separate line of their own.

## Subscripts

$$H_0 =  Z_{a + b}$$

## Superscripts

$$S = cA^z$$

Elements can be coupled and nested.

$$S = cA^Z_1 + z_{2 + x}$$

## Fractions and Greek Symbols

$$\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\delta + \gamma_x}$$

## Summation signs

$$z = \sum_{i = 1}^X{K}$$

## Escape the backslash with a custom term

$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

## Rendering plain text in a LaTeX equation

$$P(Occurence of Species A) = Z$$

$$P(\mbox{Occurence of Species A}) = Z$$

# Inserting a "Chunk" of code
```{r}
# Don't forget to start with comments
# Let's make a predictor variable

#Preliminaries
library(ggplot2)

pred <- 1:10 #vector of 10 integers
res <- runif(10) #random uniform values

#print the random numbers
print(res)

#plot the graph
qplot(x = pred, y = res)

```

Now back to writing text in our markdown document, including LaTeX equations if we need them, such as $a + b$ insertind in the middle of my sentence.
